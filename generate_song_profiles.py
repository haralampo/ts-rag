Create a concise emotional and narrative profile for this Taylor Swift song.

Song: {song}
Album: {album}

Lyrics:
{lyrics_text}

Important:
- Identify the narrator's role, not just the topic.
- Separate who is hurt from who caused the hurt.
- Separate active heartbreak from healed/reflected closure.
- This profile will be used to match songs to user situations, so POV and timeline matter.
